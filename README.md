Building a data warehouse (DWH), training a machine learning (ML) model, and creating a Power BI dashboard
A-DWH Project Requirements:
1. Identify Bus matrix for your business processes against common dimensions
2. State the dimensional modeling process for each business process
3. Using any diagramming tool you like, construct a logical data model for this case 
study. Output should be an image or PDF.
State why did you choose this particular data model design? What does the data
represent? (Details about each model component is necessary).
4. Translate the logical data model to a physical data model which includes the 
following: tables and columns (name, data type) Output should be a Word or Excel 
file.
5. Create the table in oracle/mysql DBMS and populate sample data to be used in 
your queries.
6. Construct a sample of SQL queries (5 – 8 queries) using your physical model design 
which can be used to answer possible questions by the decision maker as 
described in the case-study above. List the business question with each query. 
Output should be a Word file
7. A report of maximum 2 pages is required to elaborate different types of indexes
